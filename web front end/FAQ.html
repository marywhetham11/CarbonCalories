    <h3>Who are we</h3>
    <p>Climate change is an issue that affects our planet everyday. The human race needs to do more to fight climate change. A large contributor to climate change is our food. The production, packaging and distribution require large amounts of resources and energy. However, many people are unaware of the impact of their food consumption. Even if they are aware of the impact, many do not know how they can help solve the problem. So, the main goal of this project is to increase peopleâ€™s awareness of the environmental effect of the food that they eat.

    <h3>What is our goal</h3>
    <p>Most people struggle with finding time to take the carbon footprint on their food under consideration. Consequently, a goal of this project is to make finding low carbon footprint products as effortless as possible. We have conducted multiple user interviews of friends and family and through this research and user interviews (one such user interview is included at the end of this proposal on page 8), it was found that the best time to gain access to a typical user is when they are shopping for their food. This idea gives the project two possible directions; implement a system to go in grocery stores, or a system to be on grocery shopping websites. When interviewing, we found that older people would like to have access to the system in grocery stores, but younger people are more interested in a Google Chrome extension. Our main target users are young adults, which will be explained fully in the user characterization section, so we will gain access to typical users using a Google Chrome extension on grocery shopping sections. As we produce wireframes, prototypes, and coded elements of our project we will demonstrate them to potential targeted users (mostly friends and family due to COVID-19 restrictions) for feedback and testing, when possible.

    <h3>How can you help</h3>
    <p>It is becoming apparent that there is a big push to save the environment. To save the environment, humans need to focus on the carbon emissions of the food we eat. Since shopping for groceries online is the way of the future, many consumers would choose an online grocery shopping site that displays the carbon footprint of their order. Our Google extension makes this mission simple and time efficient. As a consumer adding items to their shopping cart, a carbon footprint score is displayed with a breakdown per item. Therefore, a customer does not have to put in any extra effort to help save the environment. A site with this technology will be valued highly by customers in comparison to competing sites lacking in this department.
